# AI-Powered Energy Forecaster ðŸ”‹âš¡

A production-grade machine learning pipeline designed to forecast building heating loads using architectural and environmental data. Built with performance, clarity, and explainability in mind, this project combines FastAPI, scikit-learn, and SHAP for real-time inference and transparent model interpretation.

Ideal for roles in **AI engineering**, **machine learning development**, or **data-driven energy analysis**, this repo highlights:

- Deployment-ready model serving with FastAPI
- Batch prediction automation via client scripts
- End-to-end explainability with SHAP visualizations
- Clean modular code for scaling and refinement

Whether you're evaluating predictive modeling skills, backend API integration, or AI explainability, this project reflects a strong foundation in applied machine learning practices.
