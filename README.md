# 🏠 Tabular Regression: Energy Efficiency Prediction

A modular machine learning pipeline for predicting heating load from building characteristics using the Energy Efficiency dataset.

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a full ML workflow for tabular regression:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Inference on new samples
- Performance tracking and explainability-ready structure

## 📁 Project Structure


data/           # Where your raw and cleaned CSV files go

models/         # Where your training scripts and saved ML models live

inference/      # Scripts that make predictions on new data

outputs/        # Auto-generated stuff: metrics, plots, visuals

notebooks/      # Optional: your Jupyter dev notebooks









## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python models/train_model.py
python inference/predict.py
